            <p class="ux-method-info">
              I analyzed how this spy camera detector application offers <span class="highlight-sentence">vague means to understand women’s safety from spy cameras in Korea</span>, and additionally how it wields the potential to <span class="highlight-sentence">abuse women’s fear and learned helplessness</span>. Since the <span class="highlight-sentence">minority group’s social psychology</span> center around these feelings, it should be acknowledged as the design elements when aiming for social impact.
              Furthermore, this acknowledgement should be followed by continuous <span class="highlight-sentence">trust work</span> between the application operators and the users, or the <span>citizens</span>.

            When the human’s basic desire to autonomously govern their world is largely betrayed by a discriminative social environment, negative psychology is produced. Therefore, this negative psychology is easily associated with minority communities. This demographic is much more susceptible to negative feelings like frustration, helplessness, fear, and depression-- stemming from intangible stigmatization and physical threats.

            When technology is not built with consideration of the minority group, this exclusion will engender the reluctance to adopt the technology, particularly for minority group members, as people can sense that the technology is not intended for them to utilize. On the other hand, appropriate relational association between the application administrators and the users (who are most likely to be Korean women) would engender social trust, which would encourage these people to become actual users.

          <h3 class="ux-method">Current Five Main Features</h3>
          <p>The Relief’s Map consists of five main features. Although its key features are detecting spy cameras and reporting the detected spot through the map, it has other features such as displaying current news articles, a home feed, and a profile resembling a social media account profile. However, these diverse features confused the users about the app’s overall purpose.
          <br />
          Since <em>Relief's Map</em> aims to help victims of spy cameras, it is inevitably linked to social innovation design, which heavily concerns the targeted minority group’s collective social psychology. If learned helplessness is a pervasive feeling within the group, it becomes more difficult for the technology to access the users.
          Therefore, <em>Relief's Map</em>'s social innovation design should be based on trust work and collective social psychology. Consequently, it is pivotal to consider the histories that led to these present dynamics if we are to create change for the future.</p>

          From the user’s perspective and with an ethnographic approach, I conducted the source of the users' distrust on the Relief's Map operators. Their distrust is heavily embedded in the social environment due to a spy cam porn epidemic. I used the insights from my research to base an initial high level, framing of the system.

              I can’t find any single reason why this app encourages women to actively upload the location status of whether spy cameras are detected or not. I think we are victims… so I don’t think we should be in charge of finding out where the cameras are. That is something the government or well, this app should provide for us. I bet most of us are already exhausted by always being aware of the potential threat and exposure to digital sex crimes, so we barely have the energy or passion left to fill out this map. Information should be offered if it were to make people use the app. (P1)

              I don’t know if I would use this app since, to be real honest, I think I have been filmed at least one time in my life -- I mean, almost every woman probably has been. I somehow got “bold” or whatever to neglect the existence of them around me. Honestly, I thought like that even when I resented this spy camera issue and protested a few times in 2018. But these days, I have become very insensible. Yes, I am still mad, but I am kind of exhausted dealing with the problem that seems unchangeable. (P4)

              I honestly think the release year was bad timing… I mean, I have engaged in several feminist activisms for the past several years, and I can definitely feel that even the most fierce people fighting for women’s rights are exhausted nowadays. If this application came out in 2018, I think it probably would have gotten more public attention even with this bad user interface and design. Because at that time, we were thirsty for the solution to these ongoing vicious crimes. (P2)

          2) choosing “pinkish” color might give some misconceptions to the users. 
          <br/>
          <b>Initial concept</b><br/>
          I tried to replace the supplementary colors with neutral color tone that gives warmth. However, I got a feedback from the company that the overall design is “greyscale”

          So I went for replacing the brand color : 
          i went for the brown/yellow skin palette color - but since the spy camera is about porn... it could trigger people in another way. 
          i concluded that it is not the best color for reducing fear and disgustedness.

            <p class="highlight-sentence">: Design technology not only “for” but also “with” the minority communities</p>
            <p>This paper in particular includes elements of participatory design, but mainly focuses on ethnography.
            Participatory Design is envisioned as a design approach to <span class="highlight-sentence">democratizing the design process by shifting the power relationships between researcher and participant.</span> Indeed, there are some limitations, such as the historical context of the research environment, community access, perceptions of materials and activities, and unintentional harm in collecting full accounts of personal narratives. Nevertheless, within the design process, the importance of Participatory Design as a means to innovate society and contribute to social equality is becoming a significant part of the social innovation design and civic design areas. Moreover, it is one of the most <span class="highlight-sentence">effective design methods for the historically oppressed and marginalized.</span> This goes beyond building the trust between the researcher or application administrator and the users who participate in the design process. 
            Instead, the method of participatory design aims to <span class="highlight-sentence">break the boundary between them</span> and therefore seeks to <span class="highlight-sentence">build equal access to the design</span>. In future research, participatory design can be utilized to further inform and expand the set of possible design choices, hoping for designing technology not only “for” but also “with” the minority communities.

            <p>
              Although this case study is focused on user experiences directly from the minority group members, for the better social innovation design, hearing out the difficulties from both sides – the for-profit corporation and the (potential) users from the devalued social group would have elicited better design results. While the civic design from the government or not-for-profit organization does not consider financial issues as its key consideration for its end goal is only aiming to better society, the for-profit organization creating social innovation design has multiple end goals: to make money as well as to better the community. Although I contacted Relief’s Map’s parent company in December 2021 and could hear out their situation, including their hardships, I was not able to include data from the corporations, which might have been a way to inform a more realistic design. Furthering this case study considering the corporation’s viewpoint would render other insights to the HCI and User Experience design academia and communities.

Nonetheless, in order for these organizations to contribute to social justice, it is crucial to first comprehend the complex reality of and social psychologies within minority groups.

            Through this case study, I insist on <span class="highlight-sentence">how design wields the potential to abuse women’s fear and learned helplessness, even unintentionally.</span> Since the end goal of the product design should be based on eliciting the optimal user experience, I suggest the usefulness of including the authentic voices of (potential) users.
